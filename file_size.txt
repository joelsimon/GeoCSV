Q: How much bigger are the MERMAID GeoCSV files that include Depth rows (instead of
just GPS and Algorithm rows).

A: For MERMAID P0006 (longest lived) over 4.77 years the old version without
depth rows contained 1849 lines, while the new version contained 14792 lines.

Meaning --

Old (w/o depth):  ~400 lines/year
New  (w/ depth): ~3100 lines/year

So it's ~8x increase, but these floats are nearing the end of their life anyway
so the files won't get that much bigger.  A generous end member might see P0006
live 6 years, meaning that a complete (but single-float) GeoCSV including depth
would ultimately be about ~19000 lines.
