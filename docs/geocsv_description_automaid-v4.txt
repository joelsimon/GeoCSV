This document only covers GeoCSV files specific to MERMAID -- Mobile Earthquake
Recording in Marine Areas by Independent Divers. For a general overview of
GeoCSV files, see the README and docs at
https://github.com/joelsimon/GeoCSV. For the software used to create these
GeoCSV files, see https://github.com/earthscopeoceans/automaid.  For details on
the location-interpolation algorithm, see Nolet et al., 2024 (SRL), doi:

GeoCSV structure: comments, header, data (ALL human readable)

____


[1] COMMENTS: begin with "#" in "# keyword: value" format. Example -->

#dataset: GeoCSV
#created: 2025-02-26T18:59:56.659Z
"#description: Metadata for drifting Mobile Earthquake Recording in Marine Areas...
#attribution: automaid v4.0.2 (https://github.com/earthscopeoceans/automaid...
#matlab_reader: https://github.com/joelsimon/GeoCSV/blob/master/readGeoCSV.m
#waterpressure2depth: 100 mbar is approximately equal to the pressure of 1 meter of water
#frequency_response: http://ds.iris.edu/data/reports/MH/MH.Mermaids.Response.V3.pdf
#lineterminator: '\n'
"#delimiter: ','"
#field_unit: unitless,iso8601,unitless,unitless,unitless,unitless,degrees_north,...
#field_type: string,datetime,string,string,string,string,float,float,float,float,...

The final two comments are of particular import:

"#field_unit" specifies data units of columns (e.g., degrees_north or Hz)
"#field_type" specifies data types of columns (e.g., string or float)

____


[2] HEADER: first line without "#", defines field (column) names, same number of
            fields as "field_unit" and "field_type" comments. Example -->

MethodIdentifier,StartTime,Network,Station,Location,Channel,Latitude,Longitude,...

____


[3] DATA: data value rows with same number of columns as in HEADER. Example -->

Measurement:GPS:u-blox_NEO-M8N,2018-06-27T19:16:42.000Z,MH,P0006,nan,nan,-14.453383,...
Algorithm(thermocline):automaid:v4.0.2,2018-06-27T19:35:41.808Z,MH,P0006,nan,nan,...
Measurement:Pressure:KELLER_Series_6,2018-06-27T19:43:55.000Z,MH,P0006,nan,nan,...
Algorithm(event):automaid:v4.0.2,2018-06-29T17:07:31.205Z,MH,P0006,00,BDH,-14.451222,...

Note there are currently four "MethodIdentifier"s unique to MERMAID:

    Measurement:GPS
    Algorithm(thermocline)
    Measurement:Pressure
    Algorithm(event):automaid

"MethodIdentifier" rows fall into one of two broad: measurement or algorithm.

* "Measurement" rows are values ACTUALLY MEASURED by a piece of hardware on MERMAID
* "Algorithm" rows are values INTERPOLATED by MERMAID-processing software "automaid"

"Measurement" and "algorithm" rows each are further subdivided into two categories:

* "Measurement:GPS" prints GPS fixes
* "Measurement:Pressure" prints ambient water pressure(^1) in mbar (100 mbar ~ 1 m)

* "Algorithm(thermocline):automaid" prints interpolated time/location of thermocline(^2) crossing
* "Algorithm(event):automaid" prints interpolated time/location of start time of data recording

(^1) this is why GeoCSV does not include "depth" in meters as a field type and
unit; depths we report elsewhere are interpolated via automaid using the quoted
conversion.

(^2) the thermocline marks the transition between "surface" and "deep (or
mixed)" layers, currently defined as 50 m depth (though changeable in automaid),
where drift velocities are markedly different (~km/hr above; ~km/day below).
