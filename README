GeoCSV is a simple text file format that describes the metadata required to
process data from moving stations (MERMAID; see http://earthscopeoceans.org/).
It fills the metadata gap of the classic multiple-miniSEED-and-one-dataless-SEED
workflow common for stationary seismometers.

GeoCSV was written primarily by Joel D. Simon, with direction from Tim Ahern
(Emeritus, IRIS/EarthScope) and Guust Nolet (Emeritus, Princeton/GeoAzur)

The format is (currently fluid and) inherently flexible, as other researchers
may mold it to fit their experiments by defining custom fields.  The archetypal
example for MERMAID uses the following "MethodIdenitifiers" for its data rows:

    "Measurement:GPS:...",
    "Measurement:Pressure:..."
    "Algorithm:automaid:..."

But there is no reason these could not be, e.g.:

    "Measurement:GPS:...",
    "Measurement:Conductivity:..."
    "Measurement:Temperature:..."
    "Measurement:Depth:..."

For a GeoCSV file describing a CTD experiment.

Rules, with the understanding the format is actively changing based on various
groups' recommendations (as it moves from development to FDSN standardization).

* There are three types of lines in a GeoCSV file: comment, header, data.

* Comments begin with "#" (hash symbol) and may be anywhere in the file.

  Exception: Comments may begin with " "# " (double-quote and hash symbol),
  e.g. as is used to protect a non-delimiting comma delimiter
  ("#delimiter: ','")

* Comments must in the form of "#keyword: value"; a comment line that cannot be
  split into two strings at ":" (colon) will throw an error in a universal reader.

* Three comment lines are required at the top of the file:

    "#delimiter: <delim>"
    "#field_type: <ftype>"
    "#field_unit: <funit>"

* The first uncommented line must be a header that describes the data in each
  column; e.g., a reader in MATLAB may use columns of the header line to define
  the fieldnames of an output structure, and a reader in Python my use them to
  define keys in an output dictionary.

* The "#field_unit" and "#field_type" comments, as well as the uncommented
  single header line, must be delimited like the data lines and have the same
  number of columns as the data rows that follow (e.g., all data columns must be
  described by a type, unit, and header name)

* NB, some of the rules proposed in this document differ from the GeoCSV file
  specification proposed in docs/GeoCSV_v2.0.4.pdf; e.g., the requirement
  proposed here of three specific known keyword-comments is not adhered to in
  the "Minimal IRIS Station example" of that document.  The author feels this
  requirement should be maintained to allow for the adoption of universal
  readers (ones that do not require, e.g., number or header lines or delimiter
  character be specified) that concurrently self-document via unit type and
  format specification.

* More to follow...
