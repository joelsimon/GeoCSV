%% ___________________________________________________________________________ %%

GeoCSV is a simple text file format that describes the metadata required to
process data from moving stations (MERMAID; see http://earthscopeoceans.org/).
It fills the metadata gap of the classic multiple-miniSEED-and-one-dataless-SEED
workflow common for stationary seismometers.

GeoCSV was written primarily by Joel D. Simon, with input from Tim Ahern
(Emeritus, IRIS/EarthScope) and Guust Nolet (Emeritus, Princeton/GeoAzur)

The format is (currently fluid and) inherently flexible, as other researchers
may mold it to fit their experiments by defining custom MethodIdentifiers.  The
archetypal example for MERMAID uses "Measurement:GPS:...",
"Measurement:Pressure:...", and "Algorithm:automaid:...", but there is no reason
these could not be, e.g., "Measurement:GPS:...",
""Measurement:Conductivity:...", "Measurement:Temperature:...", and
""Measurement:Depth:..." for a CTD-type experiment.

Rules, with the understanding the format is actively changing based on various
groups' recommendations (as it moves from development to FDSN standardization).

* Comments begin with "#" (hash symbol) and must be at the top of the document
  and contiguous (e.g., comment lines may not be interspersed with later
  METADATA or DATA lines).  Any arbitrary number of comment lines are allowed.

  Exception: Comments may begin with " "# " (double-quote and hash symbol),
  e.g. as is used to protect a non-delimiting comma delimiter
  ("#delimiter: ','")

* Two COMMENT lines are required in the from of "<description>: <value>" ->

  "#delimiter: <delimiter>" (default: "#delimiter: ','")
  "#lineterminator: <lineterminator>" (default: "#lineterminator: '\n'")

* Three METADATA (named and ordered as below) lines follow comments, which
  number the same columns as the data that follow and specify their metadata ->

  FieldUnit
  FieldType
  MethodIdentifier

* Arbitrary DATA lines follow metadata lines, each beginning (in the first,
  "MethodIdentifier" columns) with a provenance description, e.g. "Measurement"
  or "Algorithm", and further detailed (at arbitrary length) by descriptions
  separated by colons.  E.g., in the case of MERMAID - >

  Measurement:GPS:u-blox_NEO-M8N
  Measurement:Pressure:KELLER_Series_6
  Algorithm:automaid:vX.X.X-X

* Currently understood data types: "float" (unspecified size), "string" (char),
  and "datetime".

  As of writing: readGeoCSV.m in MATLAB casts "floats" to double precision,
  thought they are written in single precision in the current automaid (to match
  floats in sac/miniSEED/obspy).

  As of writing: datetimes are in pseudo-IS08601 format, in UTC, to seconds
  precision. Perhaps a future version will need better timing resolution at
  which point the readers/writers will need to be updated (I figure seconds
  precision is sufficient for GPS points when we are are dealing with MERMAID
  drifts on the order of km/day, and trace timing associated with the
  "Algorithm" rows is already contained to 1/10,000 second in the miniSEED).
